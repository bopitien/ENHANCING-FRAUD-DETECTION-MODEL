## Project Overview
In machine learning, models are often deployed and left to run, but over time, their performance can degrade due to data drift and model decay. This project highlights the importance of continuous monitoring, especially in fraud detection, where user behavior and fraud tactics change frequently. By implementing diagnostic tools, we can ensure that models stay accurate and relevant in detecting fraudulent activities.

## Key Steps and Insights
1. **Model Performance Monitoring**: Monthly tracking of model accuracy to flag specific periods with performance dips, indicating areas for further investigation.
2. **Feature Drift Detection**: Univariate drift calculations on key features like `time_since_login_min` and `transaction_amount` using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi-square tests to detect shifts in behavior.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Using correlation ranking to identify which feature drifts most significantly impacted model accuracy, particularly the `time_since_login_min`.
4. **Transaction Amount Analysis**: Monitoring average transaction amounts monthly to catch anomalies, which could signal evolving fraud tactics.
5. **Visualizing Feature Drift**: Distribution plots to visually confirm and understand drift trends over time.

## Findings and Recommendations
- **Performance Dips**: Regular performance dips indicated that the model struggled to adapt to new fraud patterns.
- **Significant Drift in Key Features**: Features like `time_since_login_min` showed drift, strongly correlating with performance drops.
- **Transaction Anomalies**: High transaction amounts flagged potential fraud, indicating a tactic shift.

**Recommendations**:
- Implement ongoing monitoring for model accuracy and feature drift.
- Set alerts for anomalies such as high transaction values or quick transaction timings.
- Regularly update the model with recent data to account for evolving patterns.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Python**: Core language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NannyML**: Used for drift detection, performance monitoring, and correlation analysis.
  - `CBPE (Confidence-Based Performance Estimation)`: Monitors model accuracy over time.
  - `UnivariateDriftCalculator`: Detects drift in continuous and categorical features.
  - `CorrelationRanker`: Analyzes the correlation between drifted features and model performance.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Visualization libraries for plotting feature distributions and performance trends.

## Results
This project demonstrates that continuous monitoring and feature drift detection are essential for maintaining a reliable fraud detection model. Distribution plots, drift scores, and correlation findings offer insights into how fraud patterns are evolving, enabling proactive model updates.

## Conclusion
With continuous monitoring, this project underscores the importance of tracking model performance and data drift to address model decay and stay ahead of evolving fraud tactics. implementing regular updates will ensure that the model remains robust and accurate in real-world applications.
